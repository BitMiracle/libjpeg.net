        * Code for extracting next Huffman-coded symbol from input bit stream.

        *
        * We use a lookahead table to process codes of up to HUFF_LOOKAHEAD bits
        * without looping.  Usually, more than 95% of the Huffman codes will be 8
        * or fewer bits long.  The few overlength codes are handled with a loop,
        * which need not be inline code.
        *
        * Notes about the HUFF_DECODE macro:
        * 1. Near the end of the data segment, we may fail to get enough bits
        *    for a lookahead.  In that case, we do it the hard way.
        * 2. If the lookahead table contains no entry, the next code must be
        *    more than HUFF_LOOKAHEAD bits long.
        * 3. jpeg_huff_decode returns -1 if forced to suspend.
