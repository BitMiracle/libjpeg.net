Welcome to the **LibJpeg.Net** library. 

LibJpeg.Net is a .NET version of original LibJpeg library developed by Tom Lane and the Independent JPEG Group (IJG). 

The library does **not** rely on GDI, GDI+ or any other imaging technologies of the .NET Framework and Windows OS. 

This software distribution includes two flavours (for general .NET applications and for Silverlight applications) of the LibJpeg.Net library, a small collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of JPEG images and documentation on the library. 

This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
